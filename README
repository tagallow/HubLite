HubLite

A simple file sharing program I made for a class in java using TCP and java RMI.

To compile: javac *.java

To run:
	java Tracker [port]

	java Client [track ip] [port]

You need to have rmiregistry running to transfer files. Right now its hard coded at port 8092 because I'm lazy.

Also nothing is commented because no one will ever read this.
