HubLite

A simple file sharing program I made for a class in java using TCP and java RMI.

To compile: javac *.java

To run:
	java Tracker [port]

	java Client [track ip] [port]

You need to have rmiregistry running to transfer files. Right now its hard coded at port 8092.

I really only uploaded this because I wanted something on github. This program is useless.
